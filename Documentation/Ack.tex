\def\baselinestretch{1.0}
\setlinespacing{1.0} I am grateful to my parents and family for their
patience and {\em love}. Without them this work would never have come into
existence (literally).

My graduate studies in the US were supported in part by the National
Petroleum Research Council.

Finally, I wish to thank the following: \,  Beth Orton and Sarah McLachlan;
{\em and } my brother (because he asked me to).
