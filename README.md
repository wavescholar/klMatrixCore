Operations are templated when possible, and specialized when necessary.

There is a unit test main cpp that has other testing code and drives the main test routines.

Project files and solution files are excluded from distribution.   

Dependencies :

	- Intel Compiler, IPP, MKL

	- all of the libraries in the Wavescholar Pckages Git Project.
